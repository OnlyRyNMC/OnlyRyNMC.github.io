## Description
I have been working on creating 3D models of my real-life PC parts using photogrammetry so that I can use them in Unreal Engine. I have achieved this by using a mixture of different programs, such as  RealityCapture and Jawset Postshot.

Below you can see some images of the work in progress, as I train a gaussian splat of a graphics card I have to look highly defined, while also lowering the poly count (to reduce file size).

GPU in RealityCapture after allignment, creating a mesh, texturzing and colouring:

Finished 3D model in UE5:

In my next update, I will show off more of the 3D models I have created of different PC parts.
