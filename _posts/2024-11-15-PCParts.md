## Description

In this project, I explore the process of turning your photos and videos into detailed 3D models using techniques like photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is a method that involves capturing multiple images or video footage of an object from various angles and using specialized software to reconstruct it into a 3D model. This process is a powerful tool for anyone looking to create digital replicas of real-world objects for use in gaming, virtual environments, or 3D printing. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience with 3D modelling, this guide will walk you through the steps, tools, and tips you need to transform your photos and videos into high-quality 3D assets.
