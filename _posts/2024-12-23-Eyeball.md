## Description
I wanted to learn how to use Blender for a mini challenge we had at university, which was to create a shader of our lecturers choice. 
We were allowed to use any software of our choosing, so I chose one I hadn't learned yet. 
I managed to create this eyeball in Blender using a variety of different shader techniques, from bumps and normal maps, to custom BSDF shaders. 
I then learned how to bake my materials and export it over to Unreal, where you can see the final product.
