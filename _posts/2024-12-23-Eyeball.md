## Description
As part of my university degree, I was tasked to create an allocated shader, so I opted to explore using software that I had never utilised before.
I chose to use Blender, the 3D modelling software. And after having learnt the ins and outs, I was able to use a variety of techniques in order to create a realistic model eyeball. 
Such techniques included: bumps,Â  normal maps and custom BSDF shaders. 
Following this, I then learnt how to bake my materials and export the product over to Unreal, when it can get finalised. 
The links to both the Unreal and Blend files follow below.
