## Description
My first attempt at using photogrammtery was by trying to recreate what was left of the St Priories wall.
I took a video of the wall, then created a point cloud of it using RealityCapture.
I then used postshot to train a gaussian splat of the wall and got this final result.
I also used the Artec Leo 3D LiDAR scanner to get part of the archway but there was a problem with the colouring process within Artec Studio.
The photogrammetry version of the wall is linked down below, and i will upload the LiDAR scanned archway once I have access to the full version of Artec Studio.
